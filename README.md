# Settlers of Catan Clone
## Technologies: Java, JavaFX

## Purpose of project
The purpose of this project was to learn about design patterns and overall object oriented programming principles including inheritance and abstraction. This was the final project for my OO Analysis & Design class. This also allowed me to learn and play with JavaFX and dig a little into linking 3D models/graphics with code.  

Throughout the files you can find comments that were added to designate specific design patterns used and other interesting elements. 
In summary, the total patterns learned were most of the 23 design patterns designated by the Gang of Four.
